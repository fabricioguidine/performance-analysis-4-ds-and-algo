# Sorting Algorithms Results

This directory contains performance analysis results for sorting algorithms.

## Structure

- `quicksort/` - QuickSort algorithm results
- `heapsort/` - HeapSort algorithm results

## Expected Results

Each subdirectory should contain performance metrics for different input sizes:

### Format

For each input size, results should include:
- Number of comparisons
- Number of swaps/copies
- Execution time (milliseconds)

### Example Result Format

```
Input Size: 1000
Comparisons: 12345
Swaps: 6789
Time (ms): 123

Input Size: 5000
Comparisons: 67890
Swaps: 34567
Time (ms): 456
...
```

## Usage

These results are referenced in the LaTeX technical report for comparative analysis between QuickSort and HeapSort.
