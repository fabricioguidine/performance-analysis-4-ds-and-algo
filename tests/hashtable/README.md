# Hash Table Results

This directory contains results from the hash table experiments (Part II).

## Structure

- `results/` - General hash table performance results
- `most_frequent_authors.txt` - List of most frequent authors

## Expected Results

### Hash Table Performance

Results should include:
- Insertion time for different numbers of records
- Number of collisions
- Load factor
- Search time

### Most Frequent Authors

The `most_frequent_authors.txt` file should contain a ranked list of authors with their frequency count.

Format:
```
1. Author Name - 1234 works
2. Author Name - 987 works
3. Author Name - 765 works
...
```

## Usage

These results are used to analyze hash table performance and identify the most frequent authors in the dataset.
