# Tree Structures Comparison

This directory contains comparative analysis results between different tree structures.

## Expected Comparisons

Comparative analysis should include:

1. **Performance Comparison**
   - Insertion time comparison (Red-Black vs B+ d=2 vs B+ d=20)
   - Search time comparison
   - Memory usage comparison

2. **Theoretical vs Empirical Analysis**
   - Complexity analysis verification
   - Height comparison
   - Node efficiency

## Files

- `comparison.tex` - LaTeX table with comparative results (optional)
- `comparison.txt` - Text-based comparison results
- Graphs or charts as needed

## Usage

These comparative results are directly referenced in the LaTeX technical report for the comparative analysis section.
