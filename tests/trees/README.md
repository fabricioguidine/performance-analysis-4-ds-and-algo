# Balanced Tree Structures Results

This directory contains performance analysis results for balanced tree structures (Part III).

## Structure

- `redblack/` - Red-Black Tree results
- `bplustree/d2/` - B+ Tree with degree 2 results
- `bplustree/d20/` - B+ Tree with degree 20 results
- `comparison/` - Comparative analysis across tree types

## Expected Results

For each tree structure, results should include:
- Insertion statistics (comparisons, operations, time)
- Search statistics (comparisons, searches, time)
- Height/level information
- Performance across different input sizes

## Usage

These results are used in the LaTeX technical report for comparative analysis between different tree structures.
