\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Sorting Algorithms}

\subsection{QuickSort}

QuickSort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. QuickSort has an average time complexity of $O(n \log n)$, but its worst-case complexity is $O(n^2)$.

\subsection{HeapSort}

HeapSort uses the heap property to sort elements. It first builds a max-heap from the input array, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the sorted array. HeapSort has a guaranteed time complexity of $O(n \log n)$ for all cases, making it more predictable than QuickSort, though typically slower in practice.

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables are data structures that allow fast access to elements through hash functions. They provide average-case constant time complexity $O(1)$ for insertion, deletion, and search operations. This project implements hash tables using open addressing with double hashing to resolve collisions.

\section{Balanced Data Structures}

\subsection{Red-Black Tree}

Red-Black trees are self-balancing binary search trees where each node has an extra bit to store its color (red or black). These trees maintain balance by ensuring that no path from root to leaf is more than twice as long as any other path, resulting in guaranteed $O(\log n)$ time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

\subsection{B+ Tree}

B+ trees are data structures optimized for disk storage and are commonly used in database systems. They are similar to B-trees but store all data in leaf nodes, with internal nodes containing only keys for navigation. B+ trees maintain a balanced structure with a minimum degree $d$, where each internal node has at least $d$ and at most $2d$ children. This structure provides efficient sequential access and is particularly suitable for large datasets.

    \item Bestseller rankings
    \item Reviews and ratings
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Metrics}

For each algorithm and data structure, the following metrics were measured:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number of comparisons}: Quantity of comparisons between elements
    \item \textbf{Number of swaps/copies}: Quantity of data movement operations
    \item \textbf{Execution time}: Total processing time in milliseconds

    \item Metrics: Machine time (not wall-clock time)
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing Methodology}

To ensure the correctness and reliability of all implemented algorithms and data structures, a comprehensive test suite was developed using modern Java testing frameworks. The testing framework validates all components of the project through unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.

\subsection{Testing Frameworks}

The test suite utilizes multiple testing frameworks to ensure comprehensive coverage:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{JUnit 5 (Jupiter)}: Primary unit testing framework for modern Java testing
    \item \textbf{JUnit 4}: Backward compatibility support for legacy tests
    \item \textbf{Mockito}: Mocking framework for isolating components under test
    \item \textbf{AssertJ}: Fluent assertions library for readable test assertions
    \item \textbf{JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness)}: Framework for precise microbenchmarking and performance measurement
    \item \textbf{Hamcrest}: Matcher library for expressive assertions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Coverage}

The test suite includes comprehensive coverage for all algorithm implementations:

\subsubsection{Sorting Algorithms Tests}

Unit tests for sorting algorithms are implemented in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{QuickSortTest.java}: Comprehensive unit tests for QuickSort algorithm
    \item \texttt{HeapSortTest.java}: Comprehensive unit tests for HeapSort algorithm
\end{itemize}

These tests validate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Edge Cases}: Empty arrays, null arrays, single element arrays
    \item \textbf{Input Variations}: Already sorted arrays, reverse sorted arrays, random order arrays
    \item \textbf{Special Cases}: Arrays with duplicate ranks, arrays with zero ranks
    \item \textbf{Correctness}: Verification that arrays are properly sorted after algorithm execution
    \item \textbf{Performance Metrics}: Tracking of comparisons, swaps, and execution time
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Testing with various input sizes (10, 100, 1000, 10000, 50000 elements)
    \item \textbf{Parameterized Tests}: Testing multiple input sizes systematically using JUnit 5 parameterized tests
\end{itemize}

Performance testing is implemented through:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{PerformanceTest.java}: Performance benchmarks for sorting algorithms
    \item \texttt{SortingBenchmark.java}: JMH microbenchmarks for precise performance measurement
\end{itemize}

    \item Algorithm comparison (QuickSort vs HeapSort) with identical input data
    \item Performance with different input distributions (sorted, reverse sorted, random)
    \item Memory efficiency and resource usage
    \item Consistent performance characteristics across multiple runs
\end{itemize}

    \item \texttt{SortingExperimentIntegrationTest.java}: Validates complete experiment execution workflow
    \item Tests multiple algorithm runs with consistency checks
    \item Verifies result reproducibility across executions
\end{itemize}

    \item Helper methods for creating test records with specific ranks
    \item Methods for verifying array sorting correctness
    \item Data cloning utilities for fair algorithm comparisons
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Execution}

All tests are executed using Maven through the Maven Surefire plugin:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{mvn test}: Executes all unit tests
    \item \texttt{mvn test -Dtest=QuickSortTest}: Execute specific test class
    \item \texttt{mvn test -Dtest=SortingBenchmark}: Execute JMH benchmarks
\end{itemize}

The test suite validates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correctness of all algorithm implementations
    \item Proper behavior of data structures under various conditions
    \item Edge cases including null inputs, empty collections, and boundary conditions
    \item Performance tracking mechanisms (comparisons, swaps, execution time)
    \item Data integrity and consistency
    \item Scalability and performance characteristics
\end{itemize}

The comprehensive test suite ensures that all implementations maintain correctness across different scenarios and edge cases, providing confidence in the experimental results presented in this report.

\section{Conclusions}

This work presented a comprehensive analysis of different data structures and algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the characteristics and performance trade-offs of each implementation, providing valuable insights for selecting appropriate data structures based on application requirements.

The analysis of sorting algorithms revealed the importance of considering both average and worst-case performance when choosing an algorithm. Hash tables proved to be highly efficient for frequency analysis tasks, while balanced trees showed consistent logarithmic performance for large datasets.

\section{Future Work}

Possible extensions of this work include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of other balanced data structures (AVL trees, Splay trees)
    \item Space complexity analysis
    \item Additional algorithm optimizations
    \item Analysis on larger datasets
    \item Parallel processing implementations
    \item Cache performance analysis
    \item Integration with continuous integration (CI) systems for automated testing
    \item Performance regression testing framework
\end{itemize}
